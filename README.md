### Calorie Calculation Algorithm
The app uses a sophisticated algorithm to estimate calories burned from steps:

```swift
// Formula considers user weight, distance, and metabolic equivalent
let stepsPerMile = 2000.0 // Average steps per mile
let miles = Double(steps) / stepsPerMile
let met = 4.3 // MET for moderate walking pace (3.5 mph)
let timeInHours = miles / averageSpeedMph
let calories = met * userWeight * timeInHours
```
